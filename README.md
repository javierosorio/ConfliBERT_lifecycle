# ConfliBERT lifecycle

This repository documents the process and technical elements for developing ConfliBERT, a domain-specific Large Language Model (LLM) specialized on political conflict and violence. 

Thanks to the support of the National Science Foundation [grants XXX], our research team developed ConfliBERT (Hu et al. [2022]([https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.400/])) to process a variety of Natural Language Procesing (NLP) tasks in English text. ConfliBERT outperforms all other LLMs in when conducting conflict specific NLP tasks and has been validated by other teams as the state of the art of Machine Learning developments by other teams of researchers (Hafner et al. [2023]([https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/introducing-an-interpretable-deep-learning-approach-to-domainspecific-dictionary-creation-a-use-case-for-conflict-prediction/BB6AD7222954A1779D97AB319621DC7E])).

Based on ConfliBERT's outstanding performance in English, the team advanced multilingual versions of ConfliBERT focused in Spanish (Yang et al. [2023]([https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10409883])) and Arabic (Alsarra et al. [2023]([https://aclanthology.org/2023.ranlp-1.11/#:~:text=2023.-,ConfliBERT%2DArabic%3A%20A%20Pre%2Dtrained%20Arabic%20Language%20Model%20for,%E2%80%93108%2C%20Varna%2C%20Bulgaria.])). Based on these developments, the research team is focused on refining and expanding the multilingual family of ConfliBERT models to additional languages.

Based on our ConfliBERT models, this repository provides intuitive and technical documentation on the different aspects of creating domain-specific LLMs by focusing on distinct stages in the lifecycle of development.

The content includes five main stages with their corresponding folders:

1. Scraping
2. Corpus
3. Pretraining
4. Training data
5. Applications

For the three first stages, the repository includes specific docummentation for different languages including:

* AR - Arabic
* EN - English
* FR - French
* HI - Hindi
* RU - Russian
* SP - Spanish
