## Introduction

This repository documents the process and technical elements for developing ConfliBERT, a domain-specific Large Language Model (LLM) specialized on political conflict and violence. 

Thanks to the support of the National Science Foundation, our research team developed ConfliBERT ([Hu et al. 2022](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.400/))to process a variety of Natural Language Procesing (NLP) tasks in English text. ConfliBERT outperforms all other LLMs in when conducting conflict specific NLP tasks and has been validated by other teams as the state of the art of Machine Learning developments by other teams of researchers ([HÃ¤ffner et al. 2023](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/introducing-an-interpretable-deep-learning-approach-to-domainspecific-dictionary-creation-a-use-case-for-conflict-prediction/BB6AD7222954A1779D97AB319621DC7E)).

Based on ConfliBERT's outstanding performance in English, the team advanced multilingual versions of ConfliBERT focused in Spanish ([Yang et al. 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10409883)) and Arabic ([Alsarra et al. 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.ranlp-1.11/#:~:text=2023.-,ConfliBERT%2DArabic%3A%20A%20Pre%2Dtrained%20Arabic%20Language%20Model%20for,%E2%80%93108%2C%20Varna%2C%20Bulgaria.)). Based on these developments, the research team is focused on refining and expanding the multilingual family of ConfliBERT models to additional languages.

Based on our ConfliBERT models, this repository provides intuitive and technical documentation on the different aspects of creating domain-specific LLMs by focusing on distinct stages in the lifecycle of development.

The content includes five main stages with their corresponding folders:

1. Scraping
2. Corpus
3. Pretraining
4. Training data
5. Applications

For the three first stages, the repository includes specific docummentation for different languages including:

* AR - Arabic
* EN - English
* FR - French
* HI - Hindi
* RU - Russian
* SP - Spanish

## Who benefits from this project?

The information in this repository intends to help different types of users with distinct levels of technical sophistication. 

Users with basic expertise in computerized social sciences interested in using ConflBERT for their own research projects will find intuitive and easy to use tools, examples, and recomendations in this repository. This type of users include graduate students in the social sciences, practitoners, security analysits, Assistant Professors. 

The repository also provides more technical information for advanced computer science users interested in developing or enhancing their own domain-specific LLMs. This includes graduate students in computer sciences, developers, senior analysts and researchers, as well as Associate and Full Professors.
